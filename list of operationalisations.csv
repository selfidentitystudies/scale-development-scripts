 concept can be described as a salient aspect of one's self-perception (e.g., “I think of myself as a green consumer”; Sparks, 2000) 
 other research 
 Several authors have suggested self-identity as a useful additional variable in the TPB (e.g., Bissonnette & Contento, 2001; Charng, Piliavin, & Callero, 1988; Cook, Kerr, & Moore, 2002; Nigbur, Lyons, & Uzzell, 2010; Terry, Hogg, & White, 1999) 
 good explanation of self identity 
 The basis of the assumed relationship between self-identity and behavioral intentions relies on identity theory (Stryker, 1968, 1980, 1987), where the self is regarded as a social construct, a set of identities related to the different roles that everyone occupies in the social settings. A role can be considered as a collection of expectations about roleappropriate behavior (Simon, 1992); it is assumed that the pattern of behaviors have been internalized as a role identity and the more salient the identity, the more it will increase the intention to implement the related behaviors (Charng et al., 1988). This is because acting a role-congruent behavior helps to confirm a person's status as a role member (Callero, 1985). 
 Consistent with this view, Terry, Hogg, and Duck (1999) argued that self-identity influences intentions because the performance of a certain behavior allows the individual to validate the self-concept that originates from role identities and helps the person to develop a positive and significant self-evaluation. Therefore, people intend to perform a behavior consistent with their personal beliefs, norms and their social roles (e.g., self-identity). The predictive power of self-identity has been found over and above the effects of other TPB variables (e.g., Charng et al., 1988; Conner & Armitage, 1998; Ries, Hein, Pihu, & Armenta, 2012), especially in the domain of food choice (Sparks & Guthrie, 1998; Sparks & Shepherd, 1992; Sparks, Shepherd, Wieringa, & Zimmermanns, 1995). This is particularly the case for self-identity as a predictor of intention (Sparks & Guthrie, 1998; Sparks & Shepherd, 1992). For example, Sparks et al. (1995), examining five dietary changes linked to fat consumption, included a measure of self-identity. This was defined as the “identification as someone who is concerned about the health consequences of diet”. They reported that this construct signifi- cantly predicted the expectations of making dietary changes independently of attitudes. Conner and Armitage's (1988) review of six similar studies, indicated that self-identity accounted for 1% of the variance in intention over and above TPB variables (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control). More recent work has shown similar effects for self-identity on intentions over and above TPB variables (Armitage & Conner, 2001b; Arnold et al., 2006; Evans & Norman, 2003; Hagger & Chatzisarantis, 2006; Mannetti, Pierro, & Livi, 2004). 
 In fact, identities produce a standard for behavior (Stryker & Burke, 2000), allowing individuals' to evaluate the congruency between behavior meanings and their identities. Negative or positive emotions could arise from this evaluation and individuals could change their behaviors if they are not consistent with identity expectations (Burke, 1980). "

 The self-identity measure was composed of three items (e.g., “I am a microblog user”, ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). 
 definition 
 Self-identity is the extent to which performing a behavior is an important component of a person's self-concept (Conner & Armitage, 1998).

 Previous studies have confirmed that self-identity explains a unique amount of variance in intention (Fielding et al., 2008; Rise, Sheeran, & Hukkelberg, 2010; Sheeran, 2002) "

 definition and references 
 Self-identity, whose relation with intention comes from identity theory (Stryker, 1987), reveals to what extent individuals consider themselves as fulfilling the criteria for any societal roles. In this context, for example, it refers to an individual’s selfidentification of being ‘‘a safe metro passenger”. Self-identity has been shown to be an independent predictor of intentions with respect to safety-related behaviors, such as speeding and risky road crossing (Chorlton et al., 2012; Elliott 2010; Evans & Norman, 1998, 2003; Watson, Tunnicliff, White, Schonfeld, & Wishart, 2007) as well as other social behaviors (Conner & Armitage, 1998; Terry, Hogg, & White, 1999).

 they also mention it like this: However, standard attitude measures may not fully capture the motivational aspects of identity which impact on behaviouralintentions; thus,self-identity may have an independent predictive capacity in addition to an indirect effect on intentions via attitudes. considerations

 Entrepreneurial Self-Identity (T1 and T3) Past TPB research on self-identity in social psychology has employed very diverse self-identity items with sometimes questionable validity such as importance scales (how important it would be for the respondent to perform a specific behavior) or self-reports concerning current behaviors. This was also criticized by Fishbein and Ajzen (2010). We thus carefully selected self-identity items that do not refer to current behavior or importance scales. Specifically, three items were adapted from earlier research on self-identity and the TPB to assess entrepreneurial selfidentity (Sparks and Shepherd 1992; Fishbein and Ajzen 2010). "

 Recent studies show that for a better prediction of conservation behaviors, ecological self-identity should be included in TRA models (Castro et al., 2009; Fielding, MacDonald, & Louis, 2008; Nigbur et al., 2010; Sparks & Shepherd, 1992). 
 Some of the recent studies with TRA and TPB include ecological self-identity as a new predictor that helps explain the internalization of new ecological and conservation ideas and norms (Armitage & Conner, 2001; Bamberg & Möser, 2007; Nigbur et al., 2010). These studies demonstrate the relevance of self-identity in predicting pro-environmental intention and behavior (Castro et al., 2009; Fielding et al., 2008; Mannetti, Pierro, & Livi, 2004; Witmarsh & O’Neill, 2010) "
