  abstract             = {Rationale: The present studies aimed to contribute to the literature on psychological variables involved in reducing red meat consumption (RMC). Objective: Study 1 investigated whether the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), plus healthy-eating and meat-eating identities, could explain intentions to reduce RMC. Study 2 evaluated the effectiveness of an SMS text message intervention on self-monitoring to reduce RMC. Methods: In Study 1, data were collected daily using online food diaries for one week and a TPB questionnaire. Study 2 was a randomised controlled trial assessing pre– and post–RMC and TPB constructs by online food diaries and questionnaires over a one-week period. Participants were Italian undergraduates in each study (Study 1: N = 405; Study 2: N = 244). In Study 2, participants were randomly allocated to control and message condition groups. Participants in the message condition group received a daily SMS, which reminded them to monitor RMC, while participants in the control group did not receive any message. Only students who completed all measures were considered in the analyses (Study 1: N = 342; Study 2: N = 228). Results: Study 1 showed that affective and instrumental attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and meat-eating identity explained intentions to reduce RMC, while subjective norm, past behaviour, and healthy-eating identity did not. Study 2 showed that an SMS intervention was effective in increasing intentions and reducing RMC. Mediation analyses indicated partial serial mediation through healthy-eating and meat-eating identities and intentions. Conclusion: The present studies provide support for the predictive validity of TPB in explaining intentions to reduce RMC and for the efficacy of an SMS intervention targeting self-monitoring in reducing RMC. Findings confirmed the important role of eating identities in explaining intentions to reduce RMC and in changing this behaviour. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract             = {This research investigated whether the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) with the addition of self-identity could predict fruit and vegetable intake when controlling for past behavior. Previous research had demonstrated the efficacy of TPB to predict intention and behavior in relation to food choice and the additional power of self-identity, but had failed assess the effects of self-identity while controlling for past behavior. At baseline (N = 210) TPB components and past behavior in relation to fruit and vegetable consumption plus self-identity as a healthy eater were measured by questionnaire in a sample of university students. At time 1, 4 weeks later, self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption was measured. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) indicated attitude, PBC and self-identity to be significant predictors of intention (subjective norm and past behavior were not significant). Intention, self-identity and past behavior were direct predictors of behavior. The current findings support the independent effect of self-identity as a healthy eater on both intentions and future behaviour when controlling for TPB variables and also past behavior. The discussion considers the importance of self-identity in changing intentions and behavior for behaviors such as fruit and vegetable consumption.

A role can be considered as a collection of expectations about roleappropriate behavior (Simon, 1992); it is assumed that the pattern of behaviors have been internalized as a role identity and the more salient the identity, the more it will increase the intention to implement the related behaviors (Charng et al., 1988). This is because acting a role-congruent behavior helps to confirm a person's status as a role member (Callero, 1985). || Consistent with this view, Terry, Hogg, and Duck (1999) argued that self-identity influences intentions because the performance of a certain behavior allows the individual to validate the self-concept that originates from role identities and helps the person to develop a positive and significant self-evaluation. Therefore, people intend to perform a behavior consistent with their personal beliefs, norms and their social roles (e.g., self-identity). The predictive power of self-identity has been found over and above the effects of other TPB variables (e.g., Charng et al., 1988; Conner & Armitage, 1998; Ries, Hein, Pihu, & Armenta, 2012), especially in the domain of food choice (Sparks & Guthrie, 1998; Sparks & Shepherd, 1992; Sparks, Shepherd, Wieringa, & Zimmermanns, 1995). This is particularly the case for self-identity as a predictor of intention (Sparks & Guthrie, 1998; Sparks & Shepherd, 1992). For example, Sparks et al. (1995), examining five dietary changes linked to fat consumption, included a measure of self-identity. This was defined as the “identification as someone who is concerned about the health consequences of diet”. They reported that this construct signifi- cantly predicted the expectations of making dietary changes independently of attitudes. Conner and Armitage's (1988) review of six similar studies, indicated that self-identity accounted for 1% of the variance in intention over and above TPB variables (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control). More recent work has shown similar effects for self-identity on intentions over and above TPB variables (Armitage & Conner, 2001b; Arnold et al., 2006; Evans & Norman, 2003; Hagger & Chatzisarantis, 2006; Mannetti, Pierro, & Livi, 2004). || In fact, identities produce a standard for behavior (Stryker & Burke, 2000), allowing individuals' to evaluate the congruency between behavior meanings and their identities. Negative or positive emotions could arise from this evaluation and individuals could change their behaviors if they are not consistent with identity expectations (Burke, 1980).},

Much research has already addressed this hot issue; however, studies examining the intentions behind microblogging behaviors are limited. This study extended the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to predict intention to microblog and other behaviors. The results showed that social identity was the greatest predictor of intention, followed by attitude and perceived behavioral control. Social identity fully mediated the effects of subjective norms and self-identity on intention. Intention significantly predicted users' microblogging behaviors. These results have important implications for industry players and marketing managers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract            = {In China metro interruptions and casualties are largely attributable to incidents involving passengers. The present study examined metro passengers’ motivations to ride in potentially risky ways by focusing on belief-based measures of the theory of planned behavior (TPB), supplemented with several variables expected to be predictive. A survey based on this extended TPB, operationalized with respect to last-second riding, pushy riding and door-forcing scenarios, was conducted on a sample of regular passengers (N = 576, 576 and 571, respectively). In support of the TPB, after controlling for the effects of passengers’ characteristics, the behavioral, normative and control beliefs accounted for a significant part of the variance in intentions to ride dangerously as depicted in the scenarios, with behavioral beliefs and control beliefs being consistently predictive across the behaviors. The inclusion of moral norms, past behavior, perceived risk and self-identity resulted in a significant increment in explained variance for each intention investigated, with past behavior being consistently predictive while moral norms and perceived risk showing significance in some scenarios and self-identity being consistently insignificant across the behaviors. Further, an extensive set of belief targets for metro safety interventions were identified by selecting those beliefs that differed most between those who intended to commit risky riding and those who did not. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed from the perspective of reducing passengers’ risky riding tendencies.

This research is the first to apply the logic of appropriateness in conjunction with the theoretical structure of the TPB and assessed whether a measure of identity appropriateness might independently predict adults' intentions to engage in binge drinking. In Study 1, participants (N = 197) completed questionnaires assessing attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, past behaviour, and identity appropriateness in relation to binge drinking. Path analysis revealed an independent predictive effect of identity appropriateness on intentions in addition to an indirect effect via attitudes. In Study 2 (N = 179), a prospective measure of behaviour was included in a similar study: Identity appropriateness again predicted intentions independently of the extended TPB predictors. It was again also found to be a strong predictor of attitudes. We suggest that the notion of identity appropriateness may assist in explaining the capacity of measures of self‐identity to predict people's behavioural intentions.

We also investigated predictors of an entrepreneurial self-identity. Design/methodology/approach: Considering a process model of entrepreneurship, we analyzed two cross-sectional T1 samples of German scientists with regard to two central tasks along the entrepreneurial process (business idea development and business founding) via path model analyses as well as data from follow-up surveys collected at T2 and T3 via regression analyses. Findings: Self-identity predicted founding intentions, above and beyond the effect of the TPB variables. Moreover, self-identity showed a characteristic moderating effect with TPB-intention predictors. Their effect was weaker or even zero at low levels of self-identity. In addition, self-identity forecasted behavior, but had no unique main or moderating effect on behavior in the TPB framework. Self-identity was predictable by past behavior, personality structure, recalled adolescent competencies, and early parental role models. Moreover, an engagement in entrepreneurial activity led to an increase in self-identity over time. Implications: The results suggest that self-identity operates as a motivational factor in entrepreneurial transitions that interacts with TPB variables in a characteristic way. An entrepreneurial self-identity develops from an early developmental stage on, but also during the working life. Originality/value: This study is unique because it integrates the occupational self-concept/self-identity construct into the TPB–entrepreneurship approach, and also delivers new implications concerning how to foster entrepreneurial motivations more effectively by taking the developing occupational self-concept into account.

  abstract            = {The present article conceptualizes morally controversial innovations as a category of innovations that raise ethical issues due to their potentially undesirable long‐term consequences on society or the natural environment. Then, it analyzes the case of biofuel crops by applying an extended version of the theory of planned behavior, which includes moral norm (i.e. the personal convictions of what is wrong or right for society) and ethical self‐identity (i.e. the extent to which one perceives himself/herself as an ethical person). The obtained results show that attitude and subjective norms are positively related to farmers' intention to grow biofuel crops. Yet the intention of those farmers with a higher ethical self‐identity is also influenced by perceived behavioral control and moral norm. In particular, moral norm negatively affects their intention to grow biofuel crops, thus restraining the adoption of this innovation. Implications for theory, as well as for policymakers interested in promoting the diffusion of morally controversial innovations, are discussed.

The study was prospective in design; data on predictors and intentions were obtained during the first collection of data, whereas the actual behavior was assessed 10 days later. Our results indicated that the TPB was a better predictor of behavioral intentions than was SCT. As expected, self-identity served as a moderator in the relationship between perceived behavioral control and behavioral intentions posited by the TPB and in the relationship between outcome expectancy and behavioral intentions posited by SCT. Self-identity was a crucial factor in predicting actual behavior within both theoretical frameworks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract             = {Objectives: This study sought to estimate the effects of a novel intervention, compared with usual chlamydia testing promotion, on chlamydia test uptake and intentions among young people living in deprived areas. The intervention was based on the theory of planned behaviour, augmented with self‐identity, and targeted the significant predictors of chlamydia testing intentions identified in the previous research. Methods: Cluster randomization was used to allocate college tutor groups (intervention n = 10; control n = 11) to the intervention or control group. The sample comprised 253 participants (intervention n = 145, control n = 108). The primary outcome was test offer uptake at the end of the session. Other outcomes measured at immediate follow‐up were intention, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, and self‐identity. Results: Generalized estimating equations, controlling for cluster effects and sexual activity, found a small but non‐significant effect of condition on test offer uptake, OR = 1.65 (95% CI 0.70, 3.88) p = .25, with 57.5% of intervention participants accepting the offer of a test compared with 40.2% of control participants. Using the same analysis procedure, small‐to‐medium intervention effects were found on other outcome variables, including a significant effect on attitudes towards chlamydia testing, OR = 1.37 (95% CI 1.00, 1.87), p = .05. Conclusions: The results provide encouraging initial evidence that this theory‐based intervention, targeting the key determinants of chlamydia testing, may help to improve chlamydia testing uptake in a high‐risk group. They support the conduct of a larger trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Using the theory of planned behavior as a guiding framework, child feeding behaviors employed, beliefs about the outcomes of feeding behaviors, perceived ease or difficultly in practicing feeding behaviors, and social norms were explored during the interviews. Thematic analysis was conducted using coding and display matrices. Mothers were motivated by nutrition outcomes when practicing positive and negative controlling feeding behaviors. Outcomes related to preservation of Indian culture and values also influenced feeding behaviors. Pressuring to eat was often practiced despite the perception of ineffectiveness. Use of food rewards was found, and use of TV to control children’s food intake despite the clear understanding of undesirable nutrition outcomes was a unique finding. Asian Indian mothers need effective child feeding strategies that are culturally appropriate. Integrating cultural beliefs in nutrition education could help support existing motivation and behavior modification. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Design: A cross‐sectional design was used for this study. Methods: Participants (N = 278, 53% male; M = 17.05 years) living in deprived areas of a UK city were recruited from a vocational education setting. Participants completed a self‐administered questionnaire, including measures of attitude, injunctive subjective norm, descriptive norm, perceived behavioural control, self‐identity, intention and past behaviour in relation to getting tested for chlamydia regularly. Results: The TPB explained 43% of the variance in chlamydia testing intentions with all variables emerging as significant predictors. However, self‐identity explained additional variance in intentions (ΔR² = .22) and emerged as the strongest predictor, even when controlling for past behaviour. Conclusions: The study identified the key determinants of intention to get tested for chlamydia regularly in a sample of young people living in areas of increased deprivation: a hard‐to‐reach, high‐risk population. The findings indicate the key variables to target in interventions to promote motivation to get tested for chlamydia regularly in equivalent samples, amongst which self‐identity is critical.

Design: The study employed a cross-sectional design using belief-based as well as direct quantitative questionnaire measures of all variables. Method: Participants (N = 208), mean age 29.7 (SD = 11.50), were employees and students of three universities. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing the TPB predictors (attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control) of intention to participate in in-flight exercise (walking and seated) and the additional variables DN and SI. Results: Regression analysis showed that all variables significantly predicted intention to engage in walking and seated exercise using direct measures. A similar pattern of results was found using belief-based measures in the context of walking. Normative beliefs did not reach significance in the belief-based model of seated exercise. Based on direct measures, the TPB accounted for 50% of the variance in intention to walk and 41% to do seated exercise after controlling for past behaviour. The additional contribution of DN was 2% for walking and 1% for seated exercise. The additional contribution of SI was 2% for walking and 2% for seated exercise. Conclusions: The results of this study support the application of TPB augmented with DN and SI in the context of walking and seated in-flight exercise. The findings can be used to aid the development of motivational strategies for health-related exercise during long-haul flight travel. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Overall, the extended TPB explained 77.0% and 74.6% of variance in blood and OD intentions, respectively. In regression analyses, common contributors to intentions across donation contexts were attitude, self-efficacy and self-identity. Normative influences varied with subjective norm as a significant predictor related to OD intentions but not blood donation intentions at the final step of regression analyses. Moral norm did not contribute significantly to blood or OD intentions. In-group altruism (family/close friends) was significantly related to OD intentions only in regressions. Future donation strategies should increase confidence to donate, foster a perception of self as the type of person who donates blood and/or organs, and address preferences to donate organs to in-group members only.

The sample consisted of 137 participants, of which 109 were female, who were recruited through a farmers market and an organic produce outlet in an Australian capital city. Participants completed an online questionnaire containing the TPB scales of attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and intention; measures of positive moral attitude and ethical self identity; and food choice motives. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to examine the predictive utility of the TPB in isolation (step 1) and the TPB expanded to include the constructs of moral attitude and ethical self-identity (step 2). The results indicated the expansion of the TPB to include these constructs added significantly to the predictive model measuring intention to purchase sustainably sourced food. The third step in the adaptation utilised this expanded TPB model and added a measure of retail channel (where consumers reported buying fresh produce) and 9 food choice motives, in order to assess the predictive utility of the inclusion of choice motivations in this context. Of the 8 food choice motives examined, only health and ethical values significantly predicted intention to purchase sustainably sourced food. However, with the addition of food choice motives, ethical self-identity was no longer a significant predictor of intention to purchase sustainably sourced food. Overall the adapted TPB model explained 76% of the variance in intention to purchase sustainably sourced food. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The relationships between recycling beliefs and recycling attitudes and between recycling intention and behavior are stronger for lower levels of subjective ambivalence. Indirect ambivalence moderates the relationship between ecological self-identity and recycling behavior in the same way. One exception is that the relationship between recycling intention and behavior is stronger for higher levels of indirect ambivalence. Moreover, indirect ambivalence mediates the effect of subjective ambivalence both on recycling intention and behavior. However, this mediation is imperfect, which suggests that there is a need to measure the two types of ambivalence when studying conservation practices.

In the absence of effective experimental techniques for changing the TPB's cognitive antecedents, the present research aimed to provide a stronger non-experimental test of the model, using causal analyses of two-wave panel data. Two studies of driver behavior were conducted in which naturally occurring within-participant changes in TPB constructs were measured over time, and used to predict corresponding within-participant changes in both intentions and behavior. A two-wave panel design was used in both studies. Study 1 had a one-month gap between baseline and follow-up. At both waves, a convenience sample comprising predominantly university students (N = 135) completed questionnaire measures of all TPB cognitions and behavior (compliance with speed limits in urban areas). Cross-lagged multiple regressions and bootstrapping procedures for testing multiple mediators supported all of the relationships proposed by the TPB. These findings were extended in study 2 using a large, non-student sample of speed limit offenders (N = 1149), a six-month gap between baseline and follow-up, and a larger number of cognitive antecedents. Participants completed postal questionnaires at both waves to measure all cognitions proposed by the two-component TPB, along with moral norm, anticipated regret, self-identity and speeding on urban roads, country roads, and fast dual carriageways or motorways. Changes in instrumental and affective attitude, descriptive norm, self-efficacy, moral norm, anticipated regret and self-identity predicted changes in intention to speed. Changes in intention and self-efficacy predicted behavior-change. Injunctive norm and perceived controllability did not predict intention or behavior-change. Additionally, direct (unhypothesized) relationships with behavior were found for affective attitude, descriptive norm and anticipated regret. The implications of the findings for theory and the development of effective behavior-change interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract        = {Background: Self-identity predicts healthy eating behaviors and intentions above and beyond Theory of Planned Behavior components (TPB; i.e., attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms), but interventions exploring the relationship between self-identity and motivation are limited. Self-as-doer identity may be an important point of intervention for healthy eating behaviors (Houser-Marko & Sheldon, 2006). Therefore, I investigated whether the experimental manipulation of a self-as-doer identity predicted improved healthy food consumption, intentions, and increased self-identity as a healthy eater compared to women who received nutritional education or no intervention directly following the intervention and one month post-intervention. Method: Participants were 79 women ages 18-53 years old (M=22.92,  SD=6.92) who were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (i.e., control, education only, or education and self-as-doer activity) and asked to record their diet for four days using a food diary and an online food frequency questionnaire. Intentions to eat a healthy diet, nutrition knowledge, identity as a healthy eater, and healthy eating behaviors were recorded over a six week period: before, after, and one month post-intervention. Repeated measures ANOVAs and hierarchal linear regressions were performed to determine if the self-as-doer intervention created change and predicted increases in intentions, self-identity, and healthy food consumption. Results: Healthy eater identity predicted intentions to eat a healthy diet and overall healthy eating behavior above and beyond TPB components, but did not predict specific food group eating behaviors. Self-as-doer participants strengthened self-identity and intentions over the course of the study, but no group differences were found. Self-as-doer participants increased overall healthy eating behaviors while education and control participants decreased overall healthy eating behaviors. Self-as-doer participants ate significantly more healthy foods at time three than did education and control participants. Discussion: Findings support the role of self-identity in predicting intentions and overall healthy eating behaviors and demonstrate a causal relationship between self-as-doer identity and change in healthy eating identity, intentions, and some behaviors. The self-as-doer intervention may provide individuals with the unique motivational tools needed for diet change. Further research refining the self-as-doer intervention, targeting other health behaviors, and employing the intervention in a clinical population is needed.

  year            = {2013},
  abstract        = {The Three-Component Model of organizational commitment (TCM) by Meyer and Allen (1991, 1997) is widely regarded as the most dominant model in organizational commitment research (Cohen, 2003, 2007). However, recent research by Solinger et al. (2008) questioned the legitimacy of the TCM as a general model of organizational commitment. More specifically, the authors criticized the TCM for grouping affective commitment as an attitude toward target with continuance and normative commitment as attitudes toward behaviors under one general label of attitudinal construct. Based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA; Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980), Solinger et al. (2008) argued that we should consider organizational commitment strictly as an attitude toward the organization (i.e., affective commitment). Based on Eagly and Chaiken's (1993) composite attitude-behavior model, the current study tested the reconceptualization of organizational commitment as a unidimensional construct reflecting employees' attitudes toward the organization (i.e., affective commitment) in predicting several organizational behaviors (i.e., considerate voice, production deviance, and behavioral engagement). In addition, I also investigated whether these organizational behaviors could be better explained by adding different classes of behavioral expectancies (i.e., utilitarian, normative and self-identity expectancies) as antecedents. Finally, I tested the mediating roles of attitude toward behaviors in the relationship between affective commitment and three behavioral expectancies and the three organizational behaviors. A sample of 258 employees in a large-sized organization in China was obtained for this study. The results suggested that none of the hypotheses of the current study was supported by the evidence in the current study. In particular, affective commitment and three classes of behavioral expectancies did not significantly predict their corresponding behaviors. In addition, I also did not find the evidence for the indirect effects from affective commitment and the behavioral expectancies on the behaviors. Several alternative explanations were provided for the results. Among those, the lack of compatibility between affective commitment and the behaviors, the existence of moderators (e.g. national culture), the lack of necessary control to perform the behaviors successfully are key factors that might lead to the current findings. Although none of the hypotheses was supported, I found limited empirical supports for the reconceptualization of organizational commitment strictly as the attitude toward the organization and that organizational behaviors could be better explained by adding appropriate behavioral expectancies to the model (Solinger et al., 2008). Finally, theoretical and practical implications of the current study as well as directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

This study assessed the psychosocial factors influencing motorcycle riders’ intentions to perform both safe and risky riding behaviours. Using an extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB), motorcycle riders (n =229) from Queensland, Australia were surveyed to assess their riding attitudes, subjective norm (general and specific), perceived behavioural control (PBC), group norm, self-identity, sensation seeking, and aggression, as well as their intentions, in relation to three safe (e.g., handle my motorcycle skilfully) and three risky (e.g., bend road rules to get through traffic) riding behaviours. Although there was variability in the predictors of intention across the behaviours, results revealed that safer rider intentions were most consistently predicted by PBC, while riskier intentions were predicted by attitudes and sensation seeking. The TPB was able to explain a greater proportion of the variance for intentions to perform risky behaviours. Overall, this study has provided insight into the complexity of factors contributing to rider intentions and suggests that different practical strategies need to be adopted to facilitate safer and reduce risky rider decisions.

Method: Validated questionnaires were used at baseline and follow-up two weeks later to assess exercise behaviour, intention, self-identity, and theory of planned behaviour concepts. Research questions were analysed using chi-square analysis, discriminant function analysis and structural equation modelling. Results were interpreted using p-values and effect sizes. Results: There was a higher proportion of exercise intenders in the strong exercise identity group than in the weak exercise identity group (81.9% vs. 14.5%) and a higher proportion of successful intenders in the high exercise identity group than in the low exercise identity group (45.5% vs. 18.2%). Affective attitude and perceived behavioural control (PBC) were the most important predictors of exercise action control. Regarding the antecedents of identity, results showed significant and small-sized associations for baseline affective attitude and perceived behavioural control and large-sized association for baseline self-identity. Conclusion: Exercise identity should be usefully employed to understand exercise motivation and action control. Affective attitude and perceived behavioural control facilitate action control and exercise identity development and are suggested to be taken into account when developing exercise interventions.

This study explores conceptual overlap between habit and identity, and examines where the two constructs fit into an extended Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) model of binge‐drinking among university students. Design: Prospective, questionnaire‐based correlational design. Methods: A total of 167 UK university students completed baseline measures of past behaviour, self‐identity, the Self‐Report Habit Index (SRHI), and TPB constructs. One week later, 128 participants completed a follow‐up behaviour measure. Results: Factor analyses of the SRHI and four identity items revealed two correlated but distinct factors, relating to habit and identity, respectively. Hierarchical regression analyses of intention and behaviour showed that identity contributed over and above TPB constructs to the prediction of intention, whereas habit predicted behaviour directly, and interacted with intentions in predicting behaviour. Habits unexpectedly strengthened the intention–behaviour relation, such that strong intenders were more likely to binge‐drink where they also had strong habits. Conclusions: Identity and habit are conceptually discrete and impact differently on binge‐drinking. Findings have implications for habit theory and measurement. Recommendations for student alcohol consumption reduction initiatives are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Participants were 538 undergraduate students who completed measures of exercise self-identity, exercise behaviour, TPB items, and behavioural and control beliefs. Regression analysis showed that self-identity was the second strongest predictor of exercise behaviour and interacted with exercise intention. Follow-up analysis showed that the intention-exercise relationship was more than three times stronger at high than at low levels of exercise self-identity. Results also showed that only a marginal part of the sample with strong exercise identities had a weak exercise intention, whereas a large part of the sample with a strong exercise intention also reported a strong exercise identity. Nevertheless, only a quarter of the sample that reported strong exercise identity and intention were sufficiently active. The results underline the notion that exercise self-identity may be a useful component for the theory of planned behaviour. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

note 2: Sparks and Guthrie (1998) spoke of concern in some research quartersthat a measure of identity may be considered to be synonymous with ameasure of past behavior, with people inferring their self-identities through the examination of their past behavior. However, many studies have foundthat self-identity independently predicts intention, even after accounting forpast behavior.},

  year                 = {2012},
  abstract             = {The current study investigated the voluntary, safe blood donation in China using an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) (including attitudes, subjective norms, descriptive norms, moral norms, self-identity, and perceived behavioral control), the Health Belief Model (HBM) (including perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and cues to action), and the Social Amplification of Risk Theory (SART) (including the concept of trust). Attitudes focus on individuals’ evaluations of the behaviors. Subjective norms (i.e., perceived social pressure to engage in the behavior), descriptive norms (i.e., individuals’ perceptions of what most people do), moral norms (i.e., personal feelings of social responsibility), and self-identity (i.e., individuals’ perceptions of their social roles) were expected to form a multidimensional higher-order concept called norms. Perceived behavioral control was hypothesized to be a second-order multidimensional construct with two components: perceived controllability (i.e., individuals’ perception that they have control over the behavior) and perceived self-efficacy (i.e., one’s confidence in his/her ability to perform the behavior). Perceived susceptibility (i.e., beliefs that a certain negative outcome will occur) and perceived severity (i.e., the evaluation about how serious the outcome could be) were proposed to converge on a higher-order construct called perceived threats. Cues to action were operationalized as the requests for blood donations from various resources (i.e., blood banks, schools, family and friends, and social groups). The concept of trust emphasized the trust in blood banks. The current study hypothesized that blood donation intentions were a positive function of attitudes toward blood donations, norms, perceived behavioral control, threats, and cues to action. Trust in blood banks was hypothesized to be positively related to attitudes toward blood donations. A panel (two-wave) survey was conducted. A convenience sample of 248 undergraduate students was recruited from a large regional university in China. The results supported the extended TPB with additional components, including descriptive norms, self-standard (moral norms and self-identity), and self-efficacy. Subjective norms, descriptive norms, and self-standard converged to create a higher order construct: Norms. The convergence in the perceived behavioral control domain (self-efficacy and controllability) and the threats domain (perceived susceptibility and severity) were not obtained. Norms and self-efficacy appeared to be two primary predictors of intentions to donate blood. The direct effects of trust in blood banks on attitudes were confirmed. The results also revealed the indirect effects of trust in blood banks on blood donations intentions. Self-efficacy and controllability predicted past blood donation frequency directly. In addition, self-efficacy mediated the effects of norms on past blood donation frequency. The HBM components (i.e., perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and cues to action) appeared to be non-significant predictors of blood donation intentions and past behaviors. This study provided a theoretic basis for designing voluntary blood donation campaigns and identified the beliefs and factors that should be targeted in the future campaigns. The current study results reinforce arguments for blood donation campaigns to appeal to social responsibility. One possible method is to frame blood donation as a socially admirable behavior. In addition, the study findings indicate that future blood donation campaigns should take advantage of the effects of perceived behavioral control on both blood donation intentions and blood donation behaviors. Study results indicate the potential utility of campaign messages that include specific coping strategies such as how to reduce barriers to blood donations.

Students (N = 763) aged 10–18 years reported their attitudes towards smoking, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, self-identity and intention to smoke while their parents (N = 525) reported their attitudes towards smoking and their current cigarette use. All the TPB variables increased from lower to higher school grade level. Multisample path analyses showed that parent’s attitudes towards smoking positively predicted students’ intention to smoke only for elementary school children. Parents’ current cigarette use did not contribute significantly. Students’ attitudes, perceived behavioural control and self-identity predicted systematically intention to smoke in contrast to the subjective norm that did not contribute at all. Perceived behavioural control contributed to a higher degree in intention to smoke for senior high school students compared to the junior high school and elementary students. Self-identity contributed to a higher degree in intention to smoke for elementary compared to the junior high school students. The results of this study suggests that the determinants of smoking vary between early and late adolescence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Method: A quantitative, within-participant, questionnaire based design was used with 112 carers to assess the performance of two TPB models. The first contained the variables: attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. The second had additional variables of self efficacy and self identity. Results: Model 1 accounted for 31% of the variance with all three variables being significant predictors. Adding variables increased the overall predictive power of the model by 4%, but resulted in a reduction in the predictive power of the individual variables. Conclusion: The results suggests the TPB is a useful model for predicting carer intentions in relation to the diet of those they support, with their perceptions of the attitudes of others towards healthy eating being a key influential factor. Ways in which this may inform interventions to improve the overall health of people with intellectual disabilities are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  year            = {2011},
  abstract        = {Genetically modified (GM) food and crops became commercially available in 1994. Since then, widespread debates and controversies about the use of biotechnology in food production have emerged, mostly in western countries. This study examined willingness to pay for non-GM food in a Taiwan sample. In conjunction with this, the theory of planned behavior (TPB) was evaluated to determine the relative importance of factors influencing purchasing behavior. In this study, Ajzen's TPB model was extended to comprise two more constructs related to willingness to pay (WTP) for non-GM food. These two added factors were Knowledge about GM food and  Self-identity. Distinguishing from previous TPB studies, this study employs path analysis to further explain the causal relationship in the model. A saturated TPB model was tested and an augmented TPB model was found to be a better framework in explaining influences on behavioral intentions. Results indicated that the majority of respondents were willing to pay a 30% premium to avoid GM tofu. The total effects of Knowledge and PBC on WTP were negative and significant indicating that more knowledge about GM food and more perceived behavior control over choosing non-GM food result in willingness to pay more for avoiding GM food. The total effects of Self-identity and Subjective Norms on WTP were positive and significant indicating that one's self-identity and perceived social pressure about eating non-GM food positively influence his or her willingness to pay for non-GM food. Furthermore, consumers' knowledge about GM food positively influences their attitude and intentions toward non-GM food. These findings unequivocally substantiate that there is a demand for non-GM foods in Taiwan. This demand calls for alternative agriculture such as Maharishi Vedic Organic Agriculture which is introduced in this study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The sample was recruited via an online advertisement and consisted of current smokers over18 years of age reporting no terminal illness. The baseline sample consisted of 81female and 49 male participants and the follow-up sample consisted of 28 female and 14 male participants. The study was administered online. Data consisted of demographic variables, dependence severity, and perceived stress. The TPB model variables were Smoking Attitude, as measured by Semantic Differential scales, Social Norm and Intent to Quit, measured using item ratings, and Self-Efficacy. Smoking outcome was measured as time to first quit attempt, number of quit attempts in the last 6 months, and longest period of abstinence in the last 6 months (dichotomized into high and low abstinence groups because of severe skew). A linear regression was run to test the first step of the TPB, predicting Intent to Quit from Personal Attitude, Social Norm, and Self-Efficacy. The current study found support for the first step of the TPB model- Personal Attitude and Social Norm predicted Intent to Quit. A series of regressions were performed to test the second step of the model, predicting Smoking Outcome from Intent to Quit, Self-Efficacy, Impulsivity, and Smoking Self-Concept. Partial support was found for the second step of the model, with Intent to Quit and Impulsivity predicting smoking outcome. Smoking Self-Concept was found to be predictive at a trend. Self-efficacy was not found to be predictive of either Intent to Quit or smoking outcome. An attrition analysis was performed to investigate predictors of study participation at follow-up. Support for the construct validity of the Smoking Self- Identity IAT was found; it was uncorrelated with Explicit Attitude and Social Desirability Bias and negatively correlated with smoking outcome. Limitations of the sample and implications for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The data was collected among 357 daily smoking students (M = 24 years). The TPB components accounted for 12.3% of the variance in quitting intentions, while the extension variables added 16.5% to the explained variance in intentions beyond the impact of the TPB. Past behaviour had the strongest impact on intentions (α = 0.30), followed by moral norms (α = 0.25), perceived behavioural control (PBC, α = 0.20), attitude (α = 0.18) and group commitment (α = −0.11). By splitting the sample into three categories of past quit attempts the picture changed, revealing that the predictive utility of the TPB increased with the number of quit attempts (no past quit attempt, R² = 1%, ns and several past quit attempts, R² = 12.3%, p < 0.001). Moreover, PBC and group commitment were significantly stronger predictors of intention among those who had several previous quit attempts compared with those who never had tried to quit smoking. The extended TPB model explained 1% and 28% of the variance in intentions among those with no and several previous quit attempts, respectively. The practical implications of these results for the development of interventions to encourage smokers to quit smoking are outlined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

One area which UK policymakers are focussing on is ‘catalyst behavior’, the notion that taking-up a new behavior (such as recycling) may cause people to adopt other pro-environmental behaviors. Yet, evidence for such ‘spill-over’ effects is so far limited, and it is unclear when and how cross-situational motivations (e.g., pro-environmental identity) may predict behavior and when contextual factors are more important. We report on a postal survey (N = 551) of pro-environmental behaviors amongst the UK public. We assess the influence of pro-environmental self-identify on consistency across a range of behaviors. Pro-environmental values, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, attitudes, and demographic factors were also measured. Findings show self-identity to be a significant behavioral determinant over and above theory of planned behavior variables for carbon offsetting behavior. However, pro-environmental self-identity was only a significant predictor for certain other pro-environmental behaviors; background variables were also important predictors.

The first questionnaire assessed attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control (PBC), and intention as well as self- and prototypical identity variables. The second questionnaire assessed mobile phone use in the previous week. It was found that all three TPB variables significantly predicted intention. The addition of identity variables improved the model with self-identity becoming the second strongest overall predictor.

Data from a field study (N=527) using questionnaire measures of predictor variables and an observational measure of recycling behaviour supported the theory. Intentions predicted behaviour, while attitudes, perceived control, and the personal norm predicted intention to recycle. The interaction between neighbourhood identification and injunctive social norms in turn predicted personal norms. Self-identity and the descriptive social norm significantly added to the original theory in predicting intentions as well as behaviour directly. A replication survey on the self-reported recycling behaviours of a random residential sample (N=264) supported the model obtained previously. These findings offer a useful extension of the theory of planned behaviour and some practicable suggestions for pro-recycling interventions. It may be productive to appeal to self-identity by making people feel like recyclers, and to stimulate both injunctive and descriptive norms in the neighbourhood.

Design: We examined prospectively students’ and community members’ decisions to register consent on a donor register and discuss organ donation wishes with family. Method: Participants completed items assessing theory of planned behaviour (TPB; attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control (PBC)), prototype/willingness model (PWM; donor prototype favourability/similarity, past behaviour), and proposed additional influences (moral norm, self-identity, recipient prototypes) for registering (N = 339) and discussing (N = 315) intentions/willingness. Participants self-reported their registering (N = 177) and discussing (N = 166) behaviour 1 month later. The utility of the (1) TPB, (2) PWM, (3) augmented TPB with PWM, and (4) augmented TPB with PWM and extensions was tested using structural equation modelling for registering and discussing intentions/willingness, and logistic regression for behaviour. Results: While the TPB proved a more parsimonious model, fit indices suggested that the other proposed models offered viable options, explaining greater variance in communication intentions/willingness. The TPB, augmented TPB with PWM, and extended augmented TPB with PWM best explained registering and discussing decisions. The proposed and revised PWM also proved an adequate fit for discussing decisions. Respondents with stronger intentions (and PBC for registering) had a higher likelihood of registering and discussing. Conclusions: People’s decisions to communicate donation wishes may be better explained via a reasoned pathway (especially for registering); however, discussing involves more reactive elements. The role of moral norm, self-identity, and prototypes as influences predicting communication decisions were highlighted also. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In support of the TPB element of the model, affective attitude and perceived controllability accounted for significant variance in intention to speed on each road type. The identity constructs accounted for additional variance in intentions to speed on 70 mph roads. The significant independent predictors of speeding intentions on 30 mph roads were affective attitude and perceived controllability. For 70 mph roads, the independent predictors of intention were affective attitude, self-identity, perceived group norm, group identification, and an interaction between perceived group norm and group identification. Consistent with predictions derived from social identity theory, decomposition of the interaction showed that perceived group norm had an increasing effect on intention with increases in group identification.

According to the framework and related theories, specific types of beliefs can be identified that have been shown to shape behavior such as using IT. The beliefs of particular interest to this study were affective and instrumental behavioral beliefs, personal and external normative beliefs, controllability and self-efficacy beliefs, object beliefs, and beliefs about the implementation process. Twenty semi-structured qualitative research interviews were conducted with physicians at two large hospitals in the Midwest. Interviews were aimed at eliciting physicians' salient beliefs about using EMR. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of interviews revealed that physicians held beliefs about the positive and negative effects of EMR use on ease and efficacy of performance, productivity and efficiency, patient outcomes such as quality and safety of care, and financial and legal outcomes for themselves, their organizations, and their patients. Physicians also identified entities that exerted social pressure by encouraging or discouraging physicians' use of EMR. Physicians mentioned several ways in which using EMR was volitionally controllable versus uncontrollable and also identified many barriers and facilitators that affected their ability to use EMR. Further data are presented on EMR-specific affective responses (e.g., frustration, resentment, enjoyment), personal norms beliefs (self identity, moral norms), beliefs about the EMR itself and the process of implementation (e.g., user involvement, management support, training and support), and beliefs about coworkers' use of and perceptions of EMR. Study findings are discussed with respect to two goals, that of behavior change and the more important goal of treating beliefs as insight into designing IT and work systems that support clinicians' (cognitive) performance.

  abstract             = {Despite the increasing popularity of social networking Web sites (SNWs), very little is known about the psychosocial variables that predict people’s use of these Web sites. The present study used an extended model of the theory of planned behavior (TPB), including the additional variables of self-identity and belongingness, to predict high-level SNW use intentions and behavior in a sample of young people ages 17 to 24 years. Additional analayses examined the impact of self-identity and belongingness on young people’s addictive tendencies toward SNWs. University students (N = 233) completed measures of the standard TPB constructs (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control), the additional predictor variables (self-identity and belongingness), demographic variables (age, gender, and past behavior), and addictive tendencies. One week later, they reported their engagement in high-level SNW use during the previous week. Regression analyses partially supported the TPB: attitude and subjective norm signficantly predicted intentions to engage in highlevel SNW use with intention signficantly predicting behavior. Self-identity, but not belongingness, signficantly contributed to the prediction of intention and, unexpectedly, behavior. Past behavior also signficantly predicted intention and behavior. Self-identity and belongingness signficantly predicted addictive tendencies toward SNWs. Overall, the present study revealed that high-level SNW use is influenced by attitudinal, normative, and self-identity factors, findings that can be used to inform strategies that aim to modify young people’s high levels of use or addictive tendencies for SNWs.

The model incorporated attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, moral norm, self-identity, and donor prototype evaluations to predict intentions to record consent on an organ donor register and discuss the organ donation decision with significant others. Participants completed surveys assessing the extended TPB constructs related to registering (n = 359) and discussing (n = 282). Results supported a role for donor prototype evaluations in predicting discussing intentions only. Both extended TPB structural equation models were a good fit to the data, accounting for 74 and 76% of the variance in registering and discussing intentions, respectively. Participants’ self-reported discussing behaviour (but not registering behaviour given low numbers of behavioural performers) was assessed 4 weeks later, with discussing intention as the only significant predictor of behaviour (Nagelkerke R² = 0.11). These findings highlight the impact of people's perceptions of a typical donor on their decisions to discuss their organ donation preference, assisting our understanding of the factors influencing individuals' communication processes in efforts to bridge the gap between organ supply and demand.

Design: A prospective survey among an initial sample of 3,411 smokers. Smoking history variables and psychosocial variables from the theory of planned behavior are also measured. Main Outcome Measures: Intention to quit smoking and smoking cessation attempts 4 months later. Results: Both smoking identity and quitting identity matter, but they appear to play different roles in explaining intention to quit and in predicting actual attempts to quit. Quitting identity is particularly important for intention to quit, whereas both quitting identity and smoking identity are important for actually trying to quit. Recent attempts to quit slightly attenuate the negative effect of smoking identity on attempts to quit. Conclusion: A broader interpretation of self-identity in terms of both current and aspired behavior offers a better understanding of when people might change health-relevant behavior.

Armitage and Mark Conner (Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 1999[Jan], Vol 29[1], 72-90). There was an error in Table 1. The means (standard deviations) for the last outcome belief measures ('Not eating a low-fat diet would make me feel guilty'), should have been -0.24 (1.97) for intenders, and -1.82 (1.57) for non-intenders. The corrected version of the table is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]1999-08085-004[/rid]). The aims of the present study are fourfold: to apply the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to eating a low-fat diet; to consider differences between self-efficacy and perceived control over behavior (PCB); to examine self-identity as a potential addition to the model; and to identify beliefs which may provide useful targets for interventions. Findings support the efficacy of the TPB as a predictor of low-fat diet. Evidence for the distinction between self-efficacy and PCB was provided by principal components analysis, patterns in prediction of intention, and the control beliefs associated with the two constructs. Self-identity was found to independently predict intention and may prove a useful addition to the TPB. Finally, specific beliefs distinguished intenders from nonintenders, providing potential targets for health interventions. The findings are discussed in the context of previous TPB research and the need for multimethod assessments of behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

There was also evidence that self-identity was a stronger predictor of intentions for participants with low rather than high environmental group membership. In accordance with the standard TPB model, participants with more positive attitudes toward and a greater sense of normative support for environmental activism also had greater intentions to engage in the behaviour.

One week after completion of the main questionnaire, participants completed a follow-up questionnaire that assessed self-reported physical activity during the previous week. The standard TPB variables--past behavior, self-identity, and group norms, but not social support influences--predicted intentions, with intention, past behavior, and self-identity predicting behavior.

  abstract        = {This purpose of this mixed methodology study was to identify and examine the motivational factors that positively and negatively influence civilian U.S. government employees to deploy to high-risk environments. U.S. government leaders continue to increase government civilian participation in military contingency operations and reconstruction efforts in high-risk environments such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) is a civilian federal law enforcement organization comprised of skilled civilian special agent personnel who provide law enforcement and counterintelligence support to the Department of the Navy (DON) in peacetime, contingency, humanitarian, and combat operations around the world. The deployment demand required by DON leadership could strain NCIS personnel resources in the future. Senior leaders from NCIS must develop effective recruitment, retention, and deployment support strategies to ensure NCIS employs and retains deployment-willing civilian special agents. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT) provided the theoretical framework for the study to examine motivational characteristics of deployment-willing civilian special agents. A sample of convenience was obtained from 266 civilian NCIS special agents. The TPB constructs attitude, subjective norm, self-efficacy, self-identity, and the BRT constructs reasons for and reasons against deployment produced statistically significant or large results, with self-identity being the most significant determinant of a civilian's intention to deploy to a high-risk environment. Significant and large positive and negative correlations were found between self-identity and BRT variables. The study revealed high deployment intentions among study participants who want to deploy to gain new experiences, support the global war on terror, gain new skills, use their skills and training, serve their country, do their part in agency deployments, and make a difference in the world. High deployment intentions were found among study participants who were in a committed relationship and whose spouse or significant other support high-risk deployments. The study revealed low deployment intentions among participants who believed joining a civilian law enforcement organization did not include military responsibilities; civilian federal law enforcement agencies should not have tactical (military-type) missions; and deployments create significant hardships on families. Participants with low deployment intentions possessed a large fear of death or injury, expressed a lack of support for the war in Iraq, and believed that deployed personnel do not receive adequate deployment support. Financial incentives were not found to be a primary predictor of high-risk deployment intentions. Female participants revealed lower self-efficacy, self-identity, and deployment intentions than male participants. Possible theoretical redundancies were identified between the primary TPB constructs attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and the BRT constructs reasons for and reasons against a behavior.

  year            = {2008},
  abstract        = {To address drug-related problems, pharmacists and physicians should collaborate to improve medication therapy. Both the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Model of Collaborative Working Relationship (CWR) could be used to examine such collaboration. Under TPB, a new approach of Norm Balance was proposed, in which each of the measurement scores of subjective norm and self-identity was weighted by its relative importance. Two preliminary studies assessed the predictive validity of Norm Balance across six behavioral intentions. Cross-sectional surveys were used among 153 business undergraduates and 176 PharmD students. Besides TPB constructs and self-identity, the surveys measured the relative importance of subjective norm and self-identity by a trade-off measure-allocating 10 points between one's important others and oneself to indicate each source's impact on intentions. Regression analyses revealed that TPB with Norm Balance explained similar intention variance to TPB with self-identity, but provided a different view about the coefficients of subjective norm and self-identity. Using both CWR and TPB, the study objective was to examine Norm Balance in predicting pharmacists' intention to collaborate with physicians to improve medication therapy. The study was a cross-sectional mail survey of a random sample of 750 Iowa pharmacists. The measures for TPB constructs, self-identity, and CWR constructs were modified from reliable and valid instruments. The relative importance was measured using two approaches-trade-off measure and separate measures. The separate measures were developed such as 'I highly care about the opinions of my important others/self on collaboration' with 7-point scale. Descriptive statistics, reliability analysis, bivariate correlations, exploratory factor analyses, and regressions were performed. The response rate was 42%, and 239 practicing pharmacists were included in data analyses. The trade-off measure was better than separate measures to reflect the relative importance. TPB with Norm Balance appeared to be a better model than TPB with self-identity to examine pharmacist-physician collaboration. Under TPB, self-efficacy and attitude were two strong predictors of pharmacists' collaborative intention. Under CWR, trustworthiness and role specification were two key factors affecting collaborative care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Students attending a primary Postgraduate Certificate in Education Course (PGCE) (n=89) were identified as 'intending strongly' or 'not intending' to teach dance. They then completed a questionnaire designed to measure their behavioural beliefs, their normative beliefs and their control beliefs in accordance with Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behaviour. They were also questioned about their feelings of self-efficacy and self-identity as prospective teachers of dance and about their perceived barriers to teaching dance effectively. The questionnaire was re-administered at the completion of the intensive dance course. Initially, no significant difference was found between the strength of behavioural beliefs, attitude and self-efficacy of intenders and non-intenders (p<.01), but a difference was found in the level of normative beliefs. Following the dance course a significant positive shift (p<.05) was shown in the intentions of the non-intenders. Significant positive relationships were found between most variables, apart from perceived behavioural control. Taken as a whole the combined contribution of these variables accounted for 32.9% of the variance in intention to teach dance, and multiple regression analysis indicated that the model was a highly significant predictor of intention. Some implications of these findings for dance teacher training are proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  year            = {2007},
  abstract        = {Traditional mass production prescribes limited employee participation in organizational decision-making, rigid job standardization, and direct control of the workforce. It is now clear that such work organization in the manufacturing sector does not offer the necessary competitive advantage to compete in the global markets. Contemporary forms of work organization in the manufacturing sector rely heavily on employee participation in order to continuously improve the performance of the production process and maintain competitive advantage. In this dissertation, I focus my attention on one of the available tools to promote employee participation, namely suggestion systems. Suggestion systems are formal communication channels between employees and management. If well implemented, a suggestion system can serve important functions within an organization and at the same time can impact the organization's bottom line. I propose and test a model of high-performance suggestion systems by building and expanding on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991). According to my theoretical model, employee participation in suggestion systems is explained and predicted by the antecedent identified by TPB. At the same time, I have considered the relationship between TPB's antecedents and a broad range of organizational characteristics that are expected to enable employee participation, such as adequacy of the suggestion system's rewards, organizational trust, levels of empowerment, supervisory support to the process of continuous improvement, and flexible employee orientation. The model has been empirically tested by administering a questionnaire to line workers employed at Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky Inc., based in Georgetown, KY. Overall, the results confirmed the predictive value of the proposed model with 35% of the variance in future participation in suggestion systems. In its current form the model appears to have good explanatory value and organizing power with 65% of explained variance in intention to submit suggestions, 41% of explained variance in attitudes toward submitting suggestions, 27% of explained variance in self-identity with submitting suggestions, and 22% of explained variance in organizational trust.

A prospective sample of 145 adolescents (M = 14 years, Time 1) participated in the study. The TPB provided good predictions of intentions (adjusted R² = 0.28). An extended TPB model including self-identity, moral norms, and the group identification and group norm interaction accounted for 39% (adjusted R²) of the variance in intentions. The TPB components did not have a direct impact on subsequent behaviour, while PB and the perceived behavioural control (PBC) intention interaction accounted for 35% of the variance in behaviour after one year.

In Study 1, participants (N=241) completed measures of an augmented version of theory of planned behaviour (TPB) that included self-identity for 30 behaviours. Using within-participants multiple regression analyses, the sample was classified into self-identity-oriented (SI-oriented) and TPB-oriented groups. Between-participants multiple regression analyses revealed that self-identity was a significantly stronger predictor of intentions and accounted for significantly more incremental variance in intentions in the SI-oriented sample compared with the TPB-oriented sample across the 30 behaviours. In Study 2, participants (N=250) completed the same TPB and self-identity measures used in Study 1 as well as measures of generalized self-concept and social physique anxiety for dieting behaviour. Results indicated that self-identity was significantly associated with the generalized self-related measures, and self-concept and social physique anxiety moderated the self-identity-intention relationship. This investigation provides some preliminary evidence to support the effect of individual differences in self-identity on the formation of intentions to act.

We used an equivalent gain task in which participants actually received the options they chose to encourage truthful responding. In conjunction with this, theory of planned behavior (TPB) components were evaluated so as to examine the relative importance of behavioral influences in this domain. Here, the TPB was extended to include additional components to measure self-identity, moral norms, and emotional involvement. Results indicated that the monetary amounts participants accepted in preference to GM food were significantly lower than those accepted in preference to non-GM food. However, the vast majority of participants were indifferent between GM and non-GM food options. All TPB components significantly predicted behavioral intentions to try GM food, with attitudes toward GM being the strongest predictor. Self-identity and emotional involvement were also found to be significant predictors of behavioral intentions but moral norms were not. In addition, behavioral intentions significantly predicted behavior; however, PBC did not. An additional measure of participants' propensity to respond in a socially desirable manner indicated that our results were not influenced by self-presentation issues, giving confidence to our findings. Overall, it appears that the majority of participants (74.5%) would purchase GM food at some price. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Objective: To identify predictors of patients' intentions and behaviors to seek drug information from physicians, pharmacists, and the Internet after DTCA exposure, using theories of planned behavior and self-efficacy. Methods: One thousand patients were randomly selected from 3,000 nationwide osteoarthritic patients. A self-administered survey examined predictors of intention including measurements of attitude toward behavior, subjective norm, perceived difficulty, self-efficacy, controllability, self-identity, intention, exposure to ads, and control variables. After 6 weeks, another survey measured respondents' information-seeking behavior. For patients exposed to DTCA, 6 multiple regressions were performed for information-seeking intention and behavior for 3 information sources: physicians, pharmacists, and the Internet. Results: The response rates were 61.9% and 80.1% for the first survey and the second survey, respectively. Four hundred and fifty-four participants reported exposure to DTCA about arthritis prescription medicines in the previous month. Over 41% of the variance in intention and over 18% of the variance in behavior were explained by the regression procedures. The consistent positive predictors of intention were attitude toward behavior, self-identity, attitude toward DTCAs of arthritis medication, and osteoarthritis pain; while the consistent positive predictors of behavior were intention and osteoarthritis pain. The strongest predictors of intention were self-identity for physicians, subjective norm for pharmacists, and attitude toward behavior for the Internet. Perceived difficulty and self-efficacy did not predict intention, and self-efficacy and controllability did not predict behavior. Conclusions: DTCA-prompted drug information-seeking may be under patients' complete volitional control. To promote information searching, efforts could be made to affect factors predicting intention. Interventions could address patients' attitude toward behavior, the influence of their important others, and their role as information seeker, respectively, for information sources like the Internet, pharmacists, and physicians.

However, several authors have provided evidence suggesting that self-identity dimensions can be a useful addition to the TPB within the domain of repeated behaviours such as recycling. To compare the predictive power of a new model of 'Self-Expressive Behaviour' with the TPB, a study was conducted in which, besides the classic variables of the TPB model (such as attitudes, subjective norms and perceived control), similarity between personal identity and 'identity of typical recyclers' was also taken into account. Two hundred and thirty Italian subjects were recruited to study behavioural intentions concerning household recycling in relation to the variables mentioned above, derived from TPB and from Identity theory. Data analysis, based on structural equation modelling, shows that personal identity contributes significantly and independently to the explanation of intentions to recycle.

Regression analyses revealed that the TPB was able to explain 25% of the variance in road-crossing intentions, over and above the influence of age and gender, with perceived behavioural control emerging as the strongest predictor. The additional variables were found to increase the predictive utility of the TPB. The results have a number of theoretical and practical implications. In particular, interventions should focus on perceptions of control in order to encourage safer road-crossing behaviour among adolescents.

Also included in the model are a number of factors hypothesized as having relationships with the determinant components of the model, including prior purchasing based on concern for the environment and concern for personal health. Survey questions were developed using focus groups. 266 participants completed the survey. Key findings were that self-identity, attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control were all significant in determining intention. In addition, these determinants were distinguished in terms of their relationships with age, gender, prior behavior, and the believability of statements by companies engaged in GM food production. Changes in intention given the nature of its determinants are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract            = {Within mainstream social psychology, consumer behavior has been explained mainly in terms of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Recently, some authors suggested that self-identity dimensions can explain different types of intentions. To compare the predictive power of a tentative new model of self-expressive consumer behavior with that of the TPB, three studies were conducted in which, besides the classical variables of the model of TPB, variables concerning self-identity were also taken into account. Three independent samples (totalling 367 male and 406 female subjects, aged 15-59 yrs) were recruited to study the intention to buy fashionable watches, trendy backpacks, and cellular telephones in relation to the aforementioned variables derived from TPB and from identity theory. Data analyses, based on structural equation modeling, show that identity variables contribute significantly to the explanation of purchase intention.

Results supported the validity of the TPB model, with subjective norm as the strongest predictor of intention. In addition, self-identity, and past behavior emerged as significant predictors of intention in the augmented model. Moreover, a moderation effect was observed for past behavior on self-identity-intention relations, the significance of which was confirmed by simple slope analysis. Based on the findings, the possibility of integrating the self-identity perspective within the TPB is suggested. Further theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

  abstract        = {This study examined whether the formation of withdrawal cognitions (i.e., leave/stay intentions) with respect to one's job, one's organization, and one's occupation could be viewed as distinct, yet parallel processes. The idea was that individuals form distinct self-identities, attitudes, subjective norms, perceptions of control over behaviors, and intentions with respect to their jobs, their organizations, and their occupations. For each work-related focus/domain (i.e., job, organization, and occupation), it was proposed that the self-identity, attitudinal, normative, perceived control, and intent variables were causally related. The causal model for each focus/domain was based on the theory of planned behavior (I. Ajzen, 1985). The possibility that domain-specific withdrawal cognitions interact to create qualitatively different withdrawal patterns was also explored. Participants were 289 volunteers who completed a written survey. The subjects tended to be female, Caucasian, married, well-educated, and middle-class individuals from the metropolitan Washington, DC and metropolitan New York areas. Contrary to expectations, most of the preliminary analyses identified only two distinct work-related domains, which were associated with parallel self-identities, attitudes, subjective norms, and withdrawal cognitions. Specifically, the underlying constructs for each type of measure represented a combined job/organization domain and a distinct occupation domain. Consequently, the focus of subsequent analyses was reduced to an examination of organizational turnover and career change. As expected, the cognitive processes for the formation of job/organization withdrawal intentions and occupation withdrawal intentions were found to be similar, yet largely distinct. However, it was tentatively concluded that, for this study's data, the theory of reasoned action (TRA; M. Fishbein & I. Ajzen, 1975) has more predictive validity than the theory of planned behavior (TPB; I. Ajzen, 1985). Due to the reduced number of domains, the investigation of withdrawal patterns solely represented an examination of external turnover/change rather than intra-organizational change of jobs/occupations. Nevertheless, this study confirmed the existence of four qualitatively different withdrawal patterns based on combined levels of job/organization withdrawal cognitions and occupation withdrawal cognitions. These findings strongly indicate that the withdrawal process is more complex and interactive than most previous research has led us to believe.

This chapter is intended to identify and address a number of potential lines of investigation that may assist in understanding a potential role for self-identity in attitude–behavior models of this kind. The argument is made that self-identity represents a potentially useful candidate to extend the TPB. After a rudimentary discussion of the basic concepts central to the theme of this chapter, the empirical evidence for the role of self-identity in the structure of the TRA and TPB is outlined. Following this, some speculative assessment is made of the reasons why one might expect independent predictive effects of measures of self-identity in the structure of these models; here the discussion encroaches in behavioral decision theory, functional approaches to attitudes, and perspectives on ambivalence. The bulk of this chapter is given over to a general discussion of some potential directions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Self-identity significantly predicted behavior intention, a relationship that was not dependent on the extent to which the behavior had been performed in the past. As expected, there was also evidence that the perceived norm of a behaviorally relevant reference group was related to behavioral intention, but only for participants who identified strongly with the group, whereas the relationship between perceived behavioral control (a personal factor) and intention was strongest for low identifiers.

The 110 participants (aged 14–67 yrs) were a sample of the general population from a large city in the North of the United Kingdom. Findings indicate that intention was the principal determinant of food choice: attitude, subjective norm, and self-identity were independently predictive of intention. There was only weak evidence to suggest effects of social desirability or questionnaire format on component relationships.

  abstract             = {Employed the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to investigate the factors underlying intentions and frequency of usage of cannabis (marihuana) over a 3-mo period in 249 college students (aged 17–59). The TPB provided good predictions of both intentions (attitude, injunctive norms, and perceived behavioural control [PBC] were significant) and behaviour (intentions were significant). Other norm measures (descriptive and injunctive norms [social norms and peer pressure, respectively]) explained additional variance in intentions. In addition, habit strength and self-identity explained significant additional portions of the variance in intentions, but not behaviour, over and above the TPB variables. Several interactions among these variables were also tested. Attitude moderated the impact of PBC on intentions. Moral norms moderated the impact of attitudes on intentions. Habit strength moderated the impact of self-identity on intentions. PBC was found to moderate the impact of intentions on behaviour. The findings are discussed in relation to how interaction effects further the understanding of the social processes by which variables are related in the TPB.

Study 1 provided support for problem-focus theory, with attitudes (but not subjective norm) predicting intention in the negative mood condition. The opposite pattern of findings held for the positive mood condition (i.e., only subjective norm predicted intention). The results of Study 2 provided further support for the problem-focus approach and for the inclusion of self identity in the theory of planned behaviour.

However, there have been few attempts to assess the proposed causal links between beliefs, attitudes, intentions and behavior. The present study was designed to assess the predictive validity and causal ordering of TPB constructs over a 3-mo period in hospital workers (aged 20–64 yrs). Findings indicate good internal and test-retest reliability of assessed components; evidence for a distinction between two processes of perceived behavioral control (self-efficacy and perceived control); support for inclusion of self-identity into the model; and predictive validity of the TPB over 3 mo. Perhaps more importantly, there was some evidence to support causal ordering between predicted TPB variables. In particular, cross-lagged panel correlation analysis supported the causal impact of self-efficacy on intention. This study supports the use of the TPB as a reliable predictor of intentions and behavior over time on a repeated behavior (food choice). It also highlights the need for further research on the relationship between attitudes, perceived behavioral control and their underlying beliefs.

The corrected version of the table is given in the erratum.] The aims of the present study are fourfold: to apply the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to eating a low-fat diet; to consider differences between self-efficacy and perceived control over behavior (PCB); to examine self-identity as a potential addition to the model; and to identify beliefs which may provide useful targets for interventions. Findings support the efficacy of the TPB as a predictor of low-fat diet. Evidence for the distinction between self-efficacy and PCB was provided by principal components analysis, patterns in prediction of intention, and the control beliefs associated with the two constructs. Self-identity was found to independently predict intention and may prove a useful addition to the TPB. Finally, specific beliefs distinguished intenders from nonintenders, providing potential targets for health interventions. The findings are discussed in the context of previous TPB research and the need for multimethod assessments of behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Results indicate that the social psychological variables under consideration were able to explain 39–52% of the variance in intentions to cross the road in the manner depicted in the scenarios. The perceived behavioral control component of the TPB emerged as the strongest predictor of pedestrians' intentions, suggesting that perceptions of control have an important role to play in road safety behavior. Results are discussed in relation to the predictive utility of the TPB in this area and possible interventions to encourage safe road crossing behavior.

Self-identity is interpreted as synonymous with self-perception or self-concept, thus, social identities are subsumed as particular kinds of self identity. 235 Ss completed a questionnaire addressing the consumption of a diet low in animal fats. The questionnaire was structured in terms of the TPB and contained additional variables that previous research has indicated to be useful predictors of intentions and behavior. A multiple regression of intentions showed self-identification as a health-conscious consumer to have a predictive effect independent of the effects of these other variables. This effect was also found in replication studies. Results show that the main study along with the 2 replication studies (in Finland and Denmark) provide evidence for predictive effects of a measure of self identity in applications of the TPB. It is concluded that these results strengthen the case for examining self identity in applications of the TRA and TPB, especially those that involve health related behaviors.

Empirical and theoretical evidence to support the addition of 6 variables to the TPB is reviewed: belief salience measures, past behavior/habit, perceived behavioral control (PBC) vs self efficacy, moral norms, self-identity, and affective beliefs. It is concluded that in each case there appears to be growing empirical evidence to support their addition to the TPB and some understanding of the processes by which they may be related to other TPB variables, intentions, and behavior. Two avenues for expansion of the TPB are presented. First, the possibility of incorporating the TPB into a dual-process model of attitude-behavior relationships is reviewed. Second, the expansion of the TPB to include consideration of the volitional processes determining how goal intentions may lead to goal achievement is discussed.

An extended Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was used to investigate Fair Trade purchasing among a university student and community sample (N = 178). First, the reliability of the extended TPB measures was confirmed via confirmatory factor analysis. Second, a proposed model predicting people’s Fair Trade purchasing behaviour showed a good fit via structural equation modelling. The model indicated that attitude, perceived behavioural control, self-identity, and moral norm predicted intentions which, in turn, predicted fair trade purchasing behaviour. The model explained 62.6% and 40.5% of the variance in intention and behaviour, respectively. Finally, a series of MANOVAs established that the underlying TPB beliefs of ‘making me feel good’; ‘reflecting my values’, and ‘being unable to afford Fair Trade products’ distinguished between people who did and did not purchase Fair Trade products. These salient beliefs, in conjunction with the identified predictors of people’s intentions and behaviour, can be used in persuasive campaigns by those advocating socially-motivated behaviour changes in our food choices.

Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constructs (attitude, subjective norm, self-efficacy) were extended with moral norm, anticipatory regret, and donor identity. Intentions and objective plasmapheresis donation for 527 recent and 166 distant participants were assessed.Results: Multi-group analysis revealed that the model was a good fit. Moral norm and self-efficacy were positively associated while role identity (suppressed by moral norm) was negatively associated with plasmapheresis intentions.Conclusions: The extended TPB was useful in identifying factors that facilitate conversion from WB to plasmapheresis donation. A superordinate donor identity may be synonymous with WB donation and, for donors with a strong moral norm for plasmapheresis, may inhibit conversion.

Aims: In addition to the constructs of a common decision-making model, the theory of planned behaviour, the present study examined the influence of student role identity and university student (in-group) identification for predicting both the initiation and maintenance of students’ attendance at voluntary peer-assisted study sessions in a statistics subject. Sample: University students enrolled in a statistics subject were invited to complete a questionnaire at two time points across the academic semester. A total of 79 university students completed questionnaires at the first data collection point, with 46 students completing the questionnaire at the second data collection point. Method: Twice during the semester, students’ attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, student role identity, in-group identification, and intention to attend study sessions were assessed via on-line questionnaires. Objective measures of class attendance records for each half-semester (or ‘term’) were obtained. Results: Across both terms, students’ attitudes predicted their attendance intentions, with intentions predicting class attendance. Earlier in the semester, in addition to perceived behavioural control, both student role identity and in-group identification predicted students’ attendance intentions, with only role identity influencing intentions later in the semester. Conclusions: These findings highlight the possible chronology that different identity influences have in determining students’ initial and maintained attendance at voluntary sessions designed to facilitate their learning.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is an FDA-approved treatment innovation for disabled PD patients, improving mobility and quality-of-life over and above the effects found using mainstay drug therapy. This research used the theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behavior to examine antecedents to neurologists initiating a discussion of DBS surgery with a hypothetical PD patient. A national, cross-sectional mail survey (with online option) was conducted among a random sample of practicing U.S. neurologists. Participants totaled 86, for a response rate of 13.9%. Hierarchical linear regression showed that adding perceived behavioral control (PBC) to attitude and subjective norm resulted in significant Δ R2 = .22 in the prediction of intention. Of the two personal normative influences proposed as extensions to the TPB, adding moral norm resulted in a significant ΔR2 = .02, whereas role identity was non-significant. Mediation analyses showed that attitude partially mediated the effects of beliefs about the target, DBS surgery. PBC fully mediated perceived knowledge, whereas treatment benefit certainty was mediated partially by PBC. Implications for communication campaigns are discussed.

  abstract        = {Pressure to utilize health information technology (IT), particularly electronic medical records (EMR), for patient care is greater than ever. Meanwhile numerous studies of health IT and EMR reveal that clinicians resist and under-use IT. The present study was a first step toward understanding the causes of clinician acceptance and use of health IT. A behavioral framework, the Theory of Planned Behavior, guided inquiry into physicians' beliefs toward and experiences with EMR for inpatient and outpatient care. According to the framework and related theories, specific types of beliefs can be identified that have been shown to shape behavior such as using IT. The beliefs of particular interest to this study were affective and instrumental behavioral beliefs, personal and external normative beliefs, controllability and self-efficacy beliefs, object beliefs, and beliefs about the implementation process. Twenty semi-structured qualitative research interviews were conducted with physicians at two large hospitals in the Midwest. Interviews were aimed at eliciting physicians' salient beliefs about using EMR. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of interviews revealed that physicians held beliefs about the positive and negative effects of EMR use on ease and efficacy of performance, productivity and efficiency, patient outcomes such as quality and safety of care, and financial and legal outcomes for themselves, their organizations, and their patients. Physicians also identified entities that exerted social pressure by encouraging or discouraging physicians' use of EMR. Physicians mentioned several ways in which using EMR was volitionally controllable versus uncontrollable and also identified many barriers and facilitators that affected their ability to use EMR. Further data are presented on EMR-specific affective responses (e.g., frustration, resentment, enjoyment), personal norms beliefs (self identity, moral norms), beliefs about the EMR itself and the process of implementation (e.g., user involvement, management support, training and support), and beliefs about coworkers' use of and perceptions of EMR. Study findings are discussed with respect to two goals, that of behavior change and the more important goal of treating beliefs as insight into designing IT and work systems that support clinicians' (cognitive) performance.

The means (standard deviations) for the last outcome belief measures ('Not eating a low-fat diet would make me feel guilty'), should have been -0.24 (1.97) for intenders, and -1.82 (1.57) for non-intenders. The corrected version of the table is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]1999-08085-004[/rid]). The aims of the present study are fourfold: to apply the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to eating a low-fat diet; to consider differences between self-efficacy and perceived control over behavior (PCB); to examine self-identity as a potential addition to the model; and to identify beliefs which may provide useful targets for interventions. Findings support the efficacy of the TPB as a predictor of low-fat diet. Evidence for the distinction between self-efficacy and PCB was provided by principal components analysis, patterns in prediction of intention, and the control beliefs associated with the two constructs. Self-identity was found to independently predict intention and may prove a useful addition to the TPB. Finally, specific beliefs distinguished intenders from nonintenders, providing potential targets for health interventions. The findings are discussed in the context of previous TPB research and the need for multimethod assessments of behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Students attending a primary Postgraduate Certificate in Education Course (PGCE) (n=89) were identified as 'intending strongly' or 'not intending' to teach dance. They then completed a questionnaire designed to measure their behavioural beliefs, their normative beliefs and their control beliefs in accordance with Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behaviour. They were also questioned about their feelings of self-efficacy and self-identity as prospective teachers of dance and about their perceived barriers to teaching dance effectively. The questionnaire was re-administered at the completion of the intensive dance course. Initially, no significant difference was found between the strength of behavioural beliefs, attitude and self-efficacy of intenders and non-intenders (p<.01), but a difference was found in the level of normative beliefs. Following the dance course a significant positive shift (p<.05) was shown in the intentions of the non-intenders. Significant positive relationships were found between most variables, apart from perceived behavioural control. Taken as a whole the combined contribution of these variables accounted for 32.9% of the variance in intention to teach dance, and multiple regression analysis indicated that the model was a highly significant predictor of intention. Some implications of these findings for dance teacher training are proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract             = {The Theory of Planned Behavior provides a useful framework to study attitudes toward participation in physical activity. The objective of the study was to test the effectiveness of an intervention in manipulating the variables of the Theory of Planned Behavior and exercise habits with 366 high school students (M = 14.2 yr., SD = .7; 201 boys and 165 girls). The students were divided into intervention and control groups. A questionnaire to measure components of the theory, and the Baecke Questionnaire of Habitual Activity measuring exercise habits, were administered. The intervention lasted 12 wk. and included posters and lectures promoting participation in physical activity. Analyses showed the intervention was effective in improving attitudes towards physical activity, perceived behavioral control, intention, and self-reported actual behavior, but it was ineffective for improving attitude strength, subjective norms, and role identity. The results provide useful information for physical education teachers interested in promoting students' positive attitudes towards physical activity.

A total of 735 25-yr-old adults participated in a mailed questionnaire survey in 1997. The TPB explained 52% of the variance in young adults' decision to eat healthily, with perceived behavioral control and subjective norms being the strongest and weakest determinants, respectively. Although role identity accounted for an additional amount of 4% of the variance in behavioral intention, past behavior did not moderate the impact of role identity on intention, as hypothesized. Neither perceived group norm nor group identification added to the prediction of intention over and above the TPB. However, group identification was found to act as a moderator on the relation between group norm and behavioral intention in the predicted direction. The wider social context seems to play a stronger role for the formation of adults' healthy eating decisions than indicated by the TPB. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Examined were the TPRB's assumption that the intention to use the Internet is a function of 3 personal factors (attitude, self-efficacy, and perception of behavioral restrictions) and of 2 social factors (subjective norm and role identity). Also tested was the assumption that Internet use is a function of 3 variables: the intention to use the Internet, the internal (self-efficacy), and external control factors (perception of behavioral restrictions). A linear structural equations modeling approach was used which simultaneously estimates parameters of a cross-sectional measurement model and a structural model. Results showed that attitude and role identity were the most important determinants of the intention to use the Internet. Intention and self-efficacy determined the use of the Internet. University students used the Internet more frequently than high school students and men more often than women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

It was hypothesized (1) that attitudes towards exercise, but not subjective norms, would predict intention to engage in regular exercise, and perceived behavioral control would significantly predict intention to exercise and behavior and (2) that past behavior, personal normative beliefs, role beliefs, level of self-monitoring, and sex role identity would mediate the influence of TPB variables on exercise level. 114 college students (mean age 22 yrs) completed questionnaires measuring predictor variables and, 3 wks later, reported exercise. Results show that past behavior was the most predictive variable. Subjective norm and attitude towards exercise were not significant predictors of intention to exercise. Self-monitoring acted as a moderator of the attitude–intention relationship. Perceived behavioral control was not a significant predictor of exercise behavior, while exercise intentions were only weak predictors. Results suggest that perceived behavioral control and perceived barriers are not equivalent, and should be treated as separate variables that contribute independently to the predictive ability of the model.

  abstract             = {The theory of planned behavior (TPB) has received considerable attention in the literature. However, there have been few attempts to assess the proposed causal links between beliefs, attitudes, intentions and behavior. The present study was designed to assess the predictive validity and causal ordering of TPB constructs over a 3-mo period in hospital workers (aged 20–64 yrs). Findings indicate good internal and test-retest reliability of assessed components; evidence for a distinction between two processes of perceived behavioral control (self-efficacy and perceived control); support for inclusion of self-identity into the model; and predictive validity of the TPB over 3 mo. Perhaps more importantly, there was some evidence to support causal ordering between predicted TPB variables. In particular, cross-lagged panel correlation analysis supported the causal impact of self-efficacy on intention. This study supports the use of the TPB as a reliable predictor of intentions and behavior over time on a repeated behavior (food choice). It also highlights the need for further research on the relationship between attitudes, perceived behavioral control and their underlying beliefs.
